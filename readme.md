# Perceptron
This extension simulates different types of colour blindness (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia) on any webpage, allowing users to experience how colourblind individuals perceive the content. It will enable a person with normal vision to perceive the world through a new lens and see how people see the same things differently.

It supports:
- **Deuteranopia**
- **Protanopia**
- **Tritanopia**

### How It Works
- Applies SVG filters to simulate colour blindness.
- Provides a user-friendly popup for filter selection.
